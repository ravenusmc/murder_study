# Murder_Project
## Intro

Yes, this project looks at a murder dataset. The data comes from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports. The site says that
the data covers murders in the U.S. from 2011 to 2014.

I will admit that I wanted to use this dataset months ago but moved onto other
projects. I decided to come back to it and make a website that will provide some
basic information about murders in the U.S. I will say that I am partly
interested in Crime and that is one reason why I wanted to work with this dataset.
I listen to True Crime Garage and Generation Why quite often as well as watch old
episodes of the TV show disappeared. So, let's see where the data takes us...
