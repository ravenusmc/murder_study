# Murder_Project
## Intro

Yes, this project looks at a murder dataset. The data comes from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports. The site says that
the data covers murders in the U.S. from 2011 to 2014.

I will admit that I wanted to use this dataset months ago but moved onto other
projects. I decided to come back to it and make a website that will provide some
basic information about murders in the U.S. I will say that I am partly
interested in Crime and that is one reason why I wanted to work with this dataset.
I listen to True Crime Garage and Generation Why quite often as well as watch old
episodes of the TV show disappeared. So, let's see where the data takes us...

(Please note, to get all of the data please head to the Kaggle site and download
the csv file there.)

# Issues

There are really not any major issues. However, there is a ton of data in this
project and I could have done a lot more with it.
